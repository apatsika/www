Welcome to my blog which is deployed on Vercel. Vercel are the authors of Nextjs which is a framework built on top of React. React is one of the most popular plaftforms to build user interfaces and many of the web interfaces that we interact with everyday including Facebook, Instagram and Netflix are built on top of the framework. In this blog I will share my experience of how I built my blog in Vercel and how I was able to get up and running with Nextjs with relative ease.

## Deployment

My blog is fully managed and deployed through Vercel. It all started when I registered for a free Hobby account. Hobby Accounts are restricted to non-commercial or personal use. Vercel offers a 14 day trial Pro Teams account which allows you to invite up to 10 members on a team. They also have an Enterprise tier for larger organizations. The Hobby account tier account was sufficient for this personal project.

Vercel provided everything I needed to deploy my blog. I have included some of the technologies that are powering my website in this section.

- ### `Git`
    Creating a new project could not have been any easier. My blog is deployed using Vercel for Git. I had the choice of importing a project from a Git repository or deploying a new project by cloning one of the curated selection of templates. I chose to deploy [the Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/introducing-tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). The Tailwind Next Starter blog provides a rich feature set as a baseline for my blog including:

    - MDX for writing JXS in markdown documents
    - Light and Dark Theme
    - Lightweight, 45kB first load JS, uses Preact in production build
    - Support for Giscus

    I did most of my development on my local machine where I ran `npm run dev` to deploy a local server on  `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes I pushed to my `main` branch in Git via `git push` where automatically deployed in my production node in Vercel.
    
    Alternatively, Vercel recommends using the `create-next-app` to deploy a new app by running the following:

    ```
    npx create-next-app@latest
    # or
    yarn create next-app
    ```

- ### `MDX`
    The blog is powered by MDX which is a authoring format thay lets you compose JSX in Markdown. I have heavily relied on content managements systems like WordPress and Craft to power my personal web projects in the past. I was surpised how easy it was to work with MDX. Markdown gives me greater flexibility in terms of managing blog posts; I found it easier to manipulate posts using Visual Studio Code. For sure this way of managing posts will not be everyones cup of tea, especially for non-technical audience since it requires some basic coding to manipulate pages. However, in my opinion working with MDX is just perfect.

- ### `Giscus`
    The comments section is powered by Giscus which lets visitors comment and react to my blog posts. Giscus is powered by Github Discussions. Giscus uses the GitHub Discussions search API to find the Discussion associated with each post based on a chosen mapping (`URL`, `pathname`, `<title>`, etc.). If a matching discussion cannot be found, the giscus bot will automatically create a discussion the first time someone leaves a comment or reaction. I was able to set the environment variables in Vercel under `Settings > Environment Variables`.

## Optimization

HubSpot defines web optimization as follows:
   > Put simply, web optimization is anything that helps your site get noticed by search engines. This starts with content that appeals to automated search engine “spiders” — pieces of code that comb the web for relevant, keyword-driven content.

This sounds simple but web optimization is such a complex topic with various tooling required. Nextjs provides out of the box optimization as a baseline, it is not an afterthought. Below I have called out a few of the many optimization functions that I have leveraged for my blog:

- ### `next/image`
    Nextjs optimizes images using a built-in next component `next/image`. This can serve images in next-generation formats (like WebP) and avoid loading larger images in smaller viewports. Other benefits include:

- ### `next/link`
    My blog leverages client side navigation using the `next/link` library. Client side rendering enables faster load time of web pages. 

- ### `next/script`
    The Next.js Script component, `next/script`, is an extension of the HTML `<script>` element. It enables developers to set the loading priority of third-party scripts anywhere in their application without needing to append directly to next/head, saving developer time while improving loading performance.

## Analytics

This is possibly my favorite feature of the Vercel which I have been using to check the performance of my blog. The analytics dashboard provides a Real Experience Score which tracks the web experiece of visitors to my blog. I am able to track the First Contenful Paint (FCP), an user-centric metric for measuring page speed. Essentially a good FCP score ensures that users who access my website are getting a good user experience. You can Upgrade to the Pro edition to see older Analytics; the Hobby account provides full days worth of events.

## Domains

Vercel provides a domain that points to the `vercel.app` by default. I configured my website to use a custom domain that is hosted in Godaddy. The domain panel makes it easy to add a new domain by typing the URL of the domain. I was given the directions to update the DNS records in Godaddy. The domain points to my production environment in Vercel.

## Security

Security is not an afterthought in Vercel. The free tier Hobby account offers Log and Source protection as well as Git Fork Protection. Log and Source protection hides the `_src` and `_logs` path by default. These paths are only accessible to me in the Vercel panel. Git Fork protection prevents the leaking of sensitive project information by requiring authorization to deploy a pull request. I will not touch on the other features since they require an upgrade form the Hobby account. 

Additionally, all network traffic is encrypted by default at no additional cost. Vercel issues free SSL certificates using a non profit plaftorm called **Let's Encrypt**.
