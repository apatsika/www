#### The Grand Canyon National Park

Nothing could have prepared us for the beauty of the canyons and now we can understand why they are one of the most difficult place to photograph. Our trip was made special by the short pit stop we made to the 7 Magic Mountains in Las Vegas before we drove to Flagstaff. Although not shown in this particular blog, we were also able to go to the Horseshoe Canyon which was by far our favorite stop. Traveling in September is peak season so if you do make it out there, be prepared for the hight numbers of tourists, but we definitely recommend a visit.
