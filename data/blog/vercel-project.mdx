## Welcome to my Nextjs blog!

Then, provide a writeup about your web application project. Imagine you are a consultant, and you are pitching a proposal deck to a client. Your report should be formatted professionally, and in such a way that you could verbally walkthrough your presentation with a homework reviewer. Your report could be a PDF document, Word Document, Slides, a Markdown file, or a web-based presentation. Your choice.

Welcome to my new blog website built on the Next.js Framework. I am new Next.js having, and learning about the new methods of web development. In this blog I will walk through my process of how I built my website including the engine that is running behind the scenes. I was able to to get up and running with the Framework even though I was a relative newbie to the platfrom.

```
git add .
git commit -m ""
git push -u origin master
```

## Deployment

#### Git

My website is deployed using Vercel for Github. Creating a new project could not have been any easier! You can import a Git repository via the UI / deploy by cloning one of the templates selection of templates. I chose to deploy [the Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/introducing-tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) which is configured with the latest technologies out of the box. Vercel automatically deployed my project in Github via the UI. The integration with Github is seamless. I spent some time customizing the template on my local server at http://localhost:3000. Once I was satified all it took was `git push` to deploy. The rest was magic.
